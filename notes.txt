The purpose of this project was to implement a simple file system structure. I started the idea for this project a couple weeks ago and thought that implementing one would be best to help myself build a deeper understanding of file systems.

As we all know, or at least those of us that studied, the structure of a file system is fairly simple. There's the superblock that contains information about the file system. It includes important information like the number of inodes and data blocks in the file system.

So I did some research on how to implement a simple file system and came across the FUSE libraries.
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)
The fuse project has two important components:
- Fuse kernel model, which is in the regular kernel repos
- libfuse userspace library

Basically, a FUSE file system is implemented as a standalone application that links with libfuse.
Basically, the file system code is implemented in userspace and the fuse libraries bridge that code to the actual kernel interfaces.

libfuse provides functions
